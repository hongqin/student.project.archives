#Explain the lines of the program if it works.

#We know our question is about redundancy
#Is it that "If an organism has redundancy, then aging will occur"?

#In poster, colored graph: system with no redundant components has a higher initial risk of failure, 
#System with more redundant components has a lower initial risk of failure

#k = failure rate

#E. Dommond used different k's (heterogeneous)
#paper used constant k (homogeneous)

#How do the standard deviations translate to more points on the graph and/or the
#number of redundant components??

#Explain the lines of the code

#What part of the code represents the components and what do we change in order to 
#represent a failed component??

#How do we represent the systems in series?

#simulate the lifespan of each component for multiple systems
