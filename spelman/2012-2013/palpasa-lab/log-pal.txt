  wrote a function to generate cdf from observations. 
To: how to use optimatizat for parameter estimation in matalb, becuase we want do maximal likelhood fit for Gompertz model.

   we ploted histogram and generated cdf based on emprical values.
todo: we need to write a funciton to calculate cdf based emprical values.

sep 18
 installed matlab,
 tryied randht(), but it gives random floating numbers, not integers. 
--------------
sep 11, 
reviewed qin 2012 proposal. 
todo: 
 using the analytic solution to plot the failure of  1, 2, 3, and 4-parallel component pathways. refer to page 533 in Gavrilov 2001 JTB.
